    <p>Before picking up a brush or hoof pick, it's most important to know how to maneuver around a horse safely. When haltering, stand to the left of your horse, slowly draw the noseband oover their muzzle so that the band on top can be pulled over their ears, and clasp the cheek piece. Always stay next to your horse to their left when leading, ideally between their head and shoulders. This keeps you "with" them, not behind where you'd have to tug, and not too far back that they don't know which direction they're going. Never wrap your lead rope around your hand in case your horse decidesto take off, in which case you'd be dragged and left with rope burn on your hands. Unless your horse ground ties, meaning that when you drop the lead rope, they're "anchored" to the ground, use the cross-ties to clip your horse in a wash stall or aisle spot. Now that your horse is out, grab a curry comb, and begin bushing in circles to loosen up any dried dirt and mud. Don't use this on their face unless it's caked with mud. Next, use a hard brush on the body and legs, brushing with the grain of their fur. Most of the dirt should be off at this point, but if you want to get extra dust and grime, use a soft brush in the same fashion. After that, grab a hoofpick and start at a front hoof. Bend down facing the back of the horse, and slowly feel down the leg. Most horses will lift their hooves after feeling you running your hand down his leg, but if he does not respond, lean into the leg gradually applying more pressure until it lifts. </p>
